            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>Javascript is a cross-platform,o object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a vareity of reasons. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximumflexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Variable Declaration:</a></span>JavaScriptvariables are containers for storing data valuies - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the cofee a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identifies unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span id="purple">var x;</span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Variable Assignment:</a></span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables = our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span id="purple">var x = 10</span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Data Types:</a></span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScriptprimitives; Boolean - <span id="purple">true </span>or <span id="purple">false;</span>null - <span id="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="purple">42 or 3.14159;</span>String - <span id="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>Array - <span id="purple">[1,2,3,4]</span>object <span id="purple">{first_name:Jane}</span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Conditionals:</a></span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditionals statemtnts in your code to accomplish this. There are the following: <span id="purple">if; else; if; else</span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Loops:</a></span>There are many different kinds of loops in every language, but they all enssentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action a number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, while you run around the track four times and then you stop. thats a loop!</li>
                        <li><span><a href="#">Functions:</a></span>Funtions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our functions this will run that code. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instructions manual and get started, first we screw the lefgs to the table then we place the table upright and done. We finished Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</li>
